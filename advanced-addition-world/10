cases b with d, /- similar to induction -/
refl,
rw add_succ at H, /- remember that != is defn equi to A = B --> false -/
exfalso,
/- i feel like there's a way to use succ_ne_zero to directly say that H is false, tho -/
/- like succ_ne_zero(H) over (a+d) or something, if that makes sense -/
have NE := succ_ne_zero (a + d),
exact NE(H),
